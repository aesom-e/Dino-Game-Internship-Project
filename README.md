# Dino Game Internship Project

This is a mock internship for secondary school students to learn about the software development process. The project is inspired by the popular Chrome Dino Game. 

Students will take over a previous intern's work and continue to develop the game. They will learn about the software development process, including documentation and code maintainability, while also learning a new library, Pygame - Community Edition.

## Getting Started

1. On this GitHub repository, click on the `<> Code` button and download the ZIP file. Extract the files and open the project in your preferred IDE.
2. In your terminal within your folder, create a virtual environment by running `python -m venv .venv`. Use `python3` if you are on a Mac/Linux on any of the commands here instead of just `python`.
3. Activate your virtual environment in your IDE/shell.
4. In your environment, install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Run the game by running `python main.py`.

## Add Your Features

Now that you have the base game from the previous intern, read through the code and understand how the game works. You can go to [Pygame-CE Docs](https://pyga.me/docs/index.html) to learn more about the library. 

Once you are familiar, begin adding your features to the game. Make sure to document well for any future interns who will take over your work!

Some features for you to consider adding:

2. Creating a transition screen by transforming surfaces
5. Change the player and enemies; change the environment
8. Add power-ups (for example score doubler, god mode, gain life)
9. Add leaderboards, keep track of it in another txt file and display the top 10
